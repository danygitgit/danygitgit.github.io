# Prologue

This is Prologue, a simple, single page responsive site template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/prologue), now available as a Jekyll theme from [Chris Bobbe](https://chrisbobbe.github.io). It features a clean, minimalistic design and a sticky sidebar with navigation-linked scrolling.

### Features

* Everything from the [original site template](https://html5up.net/prologue)
* Compatible with GitHub Pages
* **[Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration** - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Add your **social profiles** easily in `_config.yml`. Only the social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` will show up on the site footer.
* Custom 404 page (called 404.html; to activate, move to your project directory).
* Comprehensive search engine optimization (SEO) tags based on info you provide in _config.yml
